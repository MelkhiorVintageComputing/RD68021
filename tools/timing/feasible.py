"""The difference-constraint system, and Bellman-Ford.

An RTL model has no pad delays, so Section 10's limits cannot be measured from
it. They can still be answered, because every one of them is a statement about
the same unknowns: the delay from a clock edge to the pin moving.

    a budget on a pad delay             lo <= d[e] <= hi
    a required separation between pins  (t_b + d_b) - (t_a + d_a) >= m

The times t come from the simulation and are constants. Rearranged, every
constraint is `d_x - d_y <= c`, which is a weighted edge y -> x in a graph whose
shortest-path problem is feasible exactly when the graph has no negative cycle.
Bellman-Ford answers that, and its potentials are a pad-delay assignment that
meets every limit at once.

INFEASIBLE IS A PROOF. FEASIBLE IS CONDITIONAL. Each transition has its own
variable, so unless they are tied the solver may give one pin a large delay when
it asserts and a small one when it negates. Real pads do not work that way, and
it is not a hypothetical: a short bus cycle can pass a minimum-width limit only by
exploiting exactly that. `pad_skew` ties the transitions of one pin to within a
given number of nanoseconds, and the analysis defaults to 0 -- one delay per pin.
