"""Prove that no register in rtl/ initialises outside reset.

    python3 tools/reset_audit.py --top rd68021_top --build build rtl/*.sv

ASIC is a target, so there is no power-on register state. The rule (CLAUDE.md) is
that every register takes its value from the reset branch of its own `always_ff`,
and that nothing in rtl/ contains an `initial` block, a declaration-site initialiser
on anything that infers a register, or a latch.

Two checks, because either one alone can be fooled:

  source     a scan for the constructs the rule forbids. Catches intent, and names
             the file and line, but cannot see what the tool actually inferred.

  netlist    yosys to bit-level cells, then a count of flip-flop cell types. A
             register with an asynchronous reset is a different cell from one
             without -- $_DFF_PN0_ against $_DFF_P_ -- so a flop that escaped the
             rule is a cell type that should not be there. This is the check that
             cannot be argued with.

The netlist check deliberately stops at `proc; flatten; simplemap` and does NOT run
`synth`. Optimisation deletes registers whose outputs nothing reads, which on a
partly-built design is most of them -- running the full flow here reported "0
flip-flops, every one reset", which is true and worthless. Stopping before
`opt_clean` audits every register the source actually describes.

Memories are not registers. yosys leaves an inferred RAM as a $mem cell, which
this audit does not count, and there is exactly one: the instruction cache's
array (rtl/rd68021_icache.sv). It is gated by 64 valid bits that ARE reset flops,
and no lookup reads the array for an entry whose valid bit is clear, so nothing
the RAM powered up holding can be observed -- UM 4.2 clears the cache the same
way.

Exemptions are named individually in EXEMPT below, with the argument for each, and
the audit fails if a second one appears. A blanket allowance would defeat the point.
